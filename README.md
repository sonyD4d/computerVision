# Computer Vision Practical implementation 


## 1) Path 

        A path from pixel p with coordinates (x, y) to pixel q with coordinates (s, t) is a sequence of distinct pixels with coordinates:
              (x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2) â€¦ (xn, yn),where (x0, y0)=(x, y) and (xn, yn)=(s, t);
              (xi, yi) is adjacent to (xi-1, yi-1)

### Airport Distance Using Path

        - Calculate the distance between indian airports by using path 
        - Path calculated using Euclidean distance
        - Assuming 4,d and 8 connected
